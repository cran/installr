\description{
  Allows the user to choose, downloads and install - the
  latest version of Rtools for Windows.  By default, the
  function searches if RTools is installed, if not, it
  checks if it knows which version to isntall for the
  current R version, and if not - it asks the user to
  choose which Rtools version to install.
}
\details{
  RTools is a collection of software for building packages
  for R under Microsoft Windows, or for building R itself
  (version 1.9.0 or later). The original collection was put
  together by Prof. Brian Ripley; it is currently being
  maintained by Duncan Murdoch.
