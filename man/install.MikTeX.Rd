MiKTeX is a typesetting system for Microsoft Windows that is developed by Christian Schenk. It consists of an implementation of TeX and a set of related programs. MiKTeX provides the tools necessary to prepare documents using the TeX/LaTeX markup language, as well a simple tex editor (TeXworks).

MiKTeX is essential for using Sweave, knitr, and creating Vignette for R packages.
