Allows the user to downloads and install the latest version of LaTeX2RTF for Windows.

\details{
Latex2rtf tries to convert your LaTeX file into a RTF file for opening in Microsoft Word. The general idea is to try and get the things that computers are good at correct: character conversion, graphic conversion, etc. Page layout suffers because control in RTF is pretty pathetic compared to TeX. Consequently, it is likely that manual reformatting will be needed.
