\title{Downloads and runs a .exe installer file for some software from a URL}
\usage{
install.URL(
  exe_URL,
  keep_install_file = FALSE,
  wait = TRUE,
  download_dir = tempdir(),
  message = TRUE,
  installer_option = NULL,
  download_fun = download.file,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{exe_URL}{A character with a link to an installer file (with the .exe file extension)}

\item{keep_install_file}{If TRUE - the installer file will not be erased after it is downloaded and run.}

\item{wait}{should the R interpreter wait for the command to finish? The default is to NOT wait.}

\item{download_dir}{A character of the directory into which to download the file. (default is \link{tempdir}())}

\item{message}{boolean. Should a message on the file be printed or not (default is TRUE)}

\item{installer_option}{A character of the command line arguments}

\item{download_fun}{a function to use for downloading. Default is \link{download.file}. We can also use
\link[curl]{curl_download} (but it doesn't give as good of an output while downloading the file).}

\item{...}{parameters passed to 'shell'}
}
\value{
invisible(TRUE/FALSE) - was the installation successful or not. (this is based on the output of shell of running the command being either 0 or 1/2.  0 means the file was successfully installed, while 1 or 2 means there was a failure in running the installer.)
}
\description{
Gets a character with a link to an installer file, downloads it, runs it, and then erases it.
}
\details{
This function is used by many functions in the installr package.
The .exe file is downloaded into a temporary directory, where it is erased after installation has started (by default - though this can be changed)
