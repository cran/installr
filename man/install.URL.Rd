\title{Downloads and runs a .exe installer file for some software from a URL}
\usage{
install.URL(exe_URL, keep_install_file = FALSE, wait = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{exe_URL}{A character with a link to an installer
  file (with the .exe file extension)}

  \item{keep_install_file}{If TRUE - the installer file
  will not be erased after it is downloaded and run.}

  \item{wait}{should the R interpreter wait for the command
  to finish? The default is to NOT wait.}

  \item{...}{parameters passed to 'shell'}
}
\value{
invisible(TRUE/FALSE) - was the installation successful or
not. (this is based on the output of shell of running the
command being either 0 or 1/2.  0 means the file was
succesfully installed, while 1 or 2 means there was a
failure in running the installer.)

\description{
Gets a character with a link to an installer file,
downloads it, runs it, and then erases it.
}
\details{
This function is used by many functions in the installr
package. The .exe file is downloaded into a temporary
directory, where it is erased after installation has
started (by default - though this can be changed)
}
\examples{
