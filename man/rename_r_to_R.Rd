\title{Rename files' extensions in a folder from .r to .R}
\usage{
rename_r_to_R(
  subdir = ".",
  recursive = FALSE,
  message = TRUE,
  text_to_find = "\\\\.r$",
  new_extension = ".R",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{subdir}{(character) sub folder from the current working directory
in which the files should be changed. Default is "".}

\item{recursive}{(logical) FALSE. Should the function keep going
into folders and check them as well?}

\item{message}{(logical) should we output how many
files were changed. (default is FALSE)}

\item{text_to_find}{old file extension (should have $ at the end!)}

\item{new_extension}{new file extension...}

\item{...}{not used.}
}
\value{
(integer) the number of files changed
}
\description{
Rename files' extensions in a folder from .r to .R.
}
\details{
This came after a discussion with Hadley, JJ, and Martin
leading to the realization that since we are using the
R language (and not the r language), the standard is to use
.R files instead of .r

Be careful when using the recursive argument.
And remember that source("miao.r") and source("miao.R")
Are NOT the same...

\examples{
\dontrun{
rename_r_to_R() # changes only .r in the current wd
rename_r_to_R("R") # fixing the file ending inside a package directory
rename_r_to_R(recursive = TRUE) # Changes 
rename_r_to_R(recursive = TRUE, message = FALSE) # Changes 
# ALL of the .r files underneath the current 
# working directory

# First run the following in git bash:
# git config core.ignorecase false
rename_r_to_R(recursive = TRUE, text_to_find="\\\\.R$", new_extension = ".b")

# mmm, since it does not work nicely, you'd need to run the following:
# and commit between the two.
rename_r_to_R(recursive = TRUE, text_to_find="\\\\.r$", new_extension = ".b")
# commit!
rename_r_to_R(recursive = TRUE, text_to_find="\\\\.b$", new_extension = ".R")
