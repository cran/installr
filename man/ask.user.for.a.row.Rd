\usage{
ask.user.for.a.row(TABLE,
  header_text = "Possible versions to download (choose one)", questions_text)
}
\arguments{
  \item{TABLE}{a data.frame table with rows from which we
  wish the user to choose a row.  If TABLE is not a
  data.frame, it will be coerced into one.}

  \item{header_text}{the text the users sees (often a
  question) as a title for the printed table - explaining
  which row he should choose from}

  \item{questions_text}{the question the users see after
  the printing of the table - explaining which row he
  should choose from. (the default is: "Please review the
  table of versions from above, and enter the row number of
  the file-version you'd like to install: ")}
}
\value{
The row number the user has choosen from the data.frame
table.
}
\description{
The function gets a data.frame and asks the user to choose
a row number.  Once choosen, that row number is returned
from the function.
}
\details{
This function is used in \code{installr} when we are not
sure what version of the software to download, or when
various actions are available for the user to choose from.
If the user doesn't give a valid row number, the function
repeats its questions until a valid row number is chosen
(or the user escapes)

\dontrun{
version_table <- data.frame(versions = c("devel", "V 1.0.0", "V 2.0.0"))
