\details{
Notepad++ is a free (as in "free speech" and also as in
"free beer") source code editor and Notepad replacement
that supports several languages. Running in the MS Windows
environment, its use is governed by GPL License. Based on
the powerful editing component Scintilla, Notepad++ is
written in C++ and uses pure Win32 API and STL which
ensures a higher execution speed and smaller program size.
By optimizing as many routines as possible without losing
user friendliness, Notepad++ is trying to reduce the world
carbon dioxide emissions. When using less CPU power, the PC
can throttle down and reduce power consumption, resulting
in a greener environment.
