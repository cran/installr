\arguments{
\item{fast}{logical (default is FALSE). If TRUE, it overrides other parameters and uses a set of defaults to make the
R installation as fast as possible: no news, installr R, copy packages and Rprofile, keep
old packages, updated packages, without quitting current R or starting the new R.
don't use GUI, check MD5sums, keep installed file in the \link{getwd}.}

\item{browse_news}{if TRUE (and if there is a newer version of R) - it opens the browser to the NEWS of the latest version of R, for the user to read through}

\item{install_R}{TRUE/FALSE - if to install a new version of R (if one is available).  If missing (this is the default)  - the user be asked if to download R or not.Of course the installation part itself (the running of the .exe file) is dependent on the user.}

\item{copy_packages}{TRUE/FALSE - if to copy your packages from the old version of R to the new version of R. If missing (this is the default)  - the user will be asked for his preference (he should say yes, unless he is using a global library folder).}

\item{copy_site_files}{logical - if to copy your Rprofile.site and Renviron.site from the old version of R to the new version of R. If missing (this is the default)  - the user will be asked for his preference (he should say yes, unless he is using a global library folder).}

\item{keep_old_packages}{- if the keep the packages in the library of the old R installation. If missing (this is the default)  - the user will be asked for his preference (he should say yes, unless he is using a global library folder).}

\item{update_packages}{TRUE/FALSE - if to update your packages in the new version of R (all packages will be updated without asking confirmation per package) If missing (this is the default)  - the user will be asked for his preference (he should say yes, unless he is using a global library folder).  This is done by calling the Rscript in the new R.}

\item{start_new_R}{TRUE/FALSE - if to start the new R (Rgui) after we will quit the old R. Default is TRUE. It will try to start the 64 bit R version, if it does not exist, the 32 bit will be started. This may be less useful for people using RStudio or the likes.}

\item{quit_R}{TRUE/FALSE - if to quit R after the installation and package copying or not. If missing (this is the default) - the user is asked what to do.}

\item{print_R_versions}{if to tell the user what version he has and what is the latest version (default is TRUE)}

\item{GUI}{a logical indicating whether a graphics menu should be used if available.  If TRUE, and on Windows, it will use winDialog, otherwise it will use \link[utils]{menu}.}

\item{to_checkMD5sums}{Should we check that the new R installation has the files we expect it to (by checking the MD5 sums)? default is TRUE.  It assumes that the R which was installed is the latest R version. parameter is passed to install.R()}

\item{keep_install_file}{If TRUE - the installer file will not be erased after it is downloaded and run.}

\item{download_dir}{A character of the directory into which to download the file. (default is \link{tempdir}())}

\item{silent}{If TRUE - enables silent installation mode.}

\item{setInternet2}{logical. Should setInternet2(TRUE) be run. (only relevant for versions of R before 3.3.0)}

\item{cran_mirror}{URL of your preferred CRAN mirror. (default is https://cran.rstudio.com/)}

\item{...}{Other arguments (this is currently not used in any way)}
}
\value{
a TRUE/FALSE value on whether or not R was updated.

\description{
This function performs the following steps:
\itemize{
\item Check what is the latest R version.  If the current installed R version is up-to-date, the function ends (and returns FALSE)
\item If a newer version of R is available, the user is asked if to review the NEWS of the latest R version - in order to decide if to install the newest R or not.
\item If the user wishes to - the function will download and install it. (you will need to press the "next" buttons on your own)
\item Once the installation is done, you should press "any-key", and the function will proceed with copying all of your packages from your old (well, current) R installation, into your newer R installation.
\item You can then erase all of the packages in your old R installation.
\item After your packages are moved (and the old ones possibly erased), you will get the option to update all of your packages in the new version of R.
\item You will be asked if to open the Rgui of your new R.
\item Lastly - you can close the current session of your old R. 
}
}
\details{
It is worth noting that the function assumes that you are installing R in the same directory as before. That is, if the old R was on: D:\R\R-3.0.0 then the new R will be on D:\R\R-3.0.1.

\dontrun{

updateR(TRUE) # This sets "fast" to be TRUE
# # the fastest/safest upgrade option: 
# install R while keeping a copy in the working directory,
# copy packages, keep old packages, 
# update packages in the new installation.

updateR() # will ask you what you want at every decision.
