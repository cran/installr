\details{
If you are not sure if you need to update R or not, 
It is better to use updateR for updating R, since it includes more options.
But in case you wish to only install R, with no other steps taken (for example, taking care of your old packages), then you can use install.R()

See the \link{install.Rdevel} function for installing the latest R-devel version.
