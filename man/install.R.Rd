\details{
If you are not sure if you need to update R or not, It is
better to use updateR for updating R, since it includes
more options. But in case you wish to only install R, with
no other steps taken (for example, taking care of your old
packages), then you can use install.R()

See the \link{install.Rdevel} function for installing the
latest R-devel version.
