installR 0.8
--------------

FIXES FOR CRAN SUBMISSION:
   * Fixed some spelling mistakes in DESCRIPTION,
   * Made sure to run the checks in the latest R version (R 2.15.3, oh the irony)
   * Changed update.R to be called updateR (in order to avoid confusing it as an S3 variation to 'update')


My thanks goes to Prof Brian Ripley for his help.
