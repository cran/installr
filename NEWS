   * Removed shutdown (turned into os.shutdown), and made sure it uses "force" shutdown.


installR 0.8.5
--------------

NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED:
   * installr - allows the user to choose which software to install (from a GUI or console based menu system)
   * A new GUI for Rgui - added the "Update" to the menu, with three submenu items: Update R, Update R Packages, and Installing software. (thanks to Dason and Yihui Xie for their ideas and help)
   * shutdown - Shut down the operating system with the command `shutdown'.  A modified version of Yihui's shitdown function from the {fun} package (see: https://github.com/yihui/fun/blob/master/R/shutdown.R)
   * is.RStudio - checks if the current R session is running within RStudio or not.
   * is.Rgui - checks if the current R session is running within Rgui or not.
   * add.installr.GUI and remove.installr.GUI - for adding a menu system to Rgui

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * install.URL - 
      * added a "wait" parameter with default as F (it now means that R doesn't wait for the installation of the software to finish before it releases the console).  And also "..." with access to the shell command run.
      * Made sure that if keep_install_file = FALSE then wait= TRUE (since otherwise, we'll erase the file before we get to run it)
      * output now returns TRUE/FLASE on whether the installation worked or not.
   * install.?? - now returns TRUE/FLASE on whether to installation worked or not.
   * install.R - Now uses MD5sums to check the newly installed R has all of the files it should.
   * updateR - 
      * added a menu based GUI!
      * added setInternet2(TRUE) for when updating packages (to help it work with specification of proxies, etc.). (this seems to be safe for regular users - but I hope it won't cause new problems.).  Thanks to a bug report by Gilbert PÃ©tain-Coup.
      * now checks if R was installed or not (Based on the output of install.R), and removed the need to ask the user that.
   * ask.user.yn.question - added a menu based GUI.
   * check.for.updates.R - added a menu based GUI.

BUG FIXES:
   * Fixed a bug in updateR, to make sure it will be able to open the new Rgui, and also close the old R.
   * Fixed a bug in updateR, "Error in !install_R : 'install_R' is missing" (install_R was called in too early) (thanks to AC for the bug report!)


installR 0.8 (2013-03-05)
-------------------------

FIXES FOR CRAN SUBMISSION:
   * Fixed some spelling mistakes in DESCRIPTION,
   * Made sure to run the checks in the latest R version (R 2.15.3, oh the irony)
   * Changed update.R to be called updateR (in order to avoid confusing it as an S3 variation to 'update')
   * installR 0.8 is to be shiped to CRAN.


My thanks goes to Prof Brian Ripley for his help.

TODO for future releases:

	* uninstall.R() for the old version of R (including the library folder)
	* Better integration with the "global library" strategy
	* Add install.notepad and install.notepadpp
   * Maybe add some timer to the os.manage functions.  And also allow input for how long from x time to perform the action.
   * make the os.manage work by running an Rscript, in order to allow for their use in long running of knitr/Sweave projects.
   * Add a rate function for the package
   * Add automatic check for a new R version every X time.
   * a way to copy/move Rprofile.site from one installation to the next such as "C:\Program Files\R\R-2.15.2\etc\Rprofile.site" to "C:\Program Files\R\R-2.15.3\etc\Rprofile.site"? (requested by: Farrel Buchinsky)
