#' @title Checks for the latest R version, and if there is a newer version of R - downloads and installs it.

#' updater
#' @description This function performs the following steps:
#' \itemize{
#' \item Check what is the latest R version.  If the current installed R version is up-to-date, the function ends (and returns FALSE)
#' \item If a newer version of R is available, the user is asked if to review the NEWS of the latest R version - in order to decide if to install the newest R or not.
#' \item If the user wishes to - the function will download and install it. (you will need to press the "next" buttons on your own)
#' \item Once the installation is done, you should press "any-key", and the function will proceed with copying all of your packages from your old (well, current) R installation, into your newer R installation.
#' \item You can then erase all of the packages in your old R installation.
#' \item After your packages are moved (and the old ones possibly erased), you will get the option to update all of your packages in the new version of R.
#' \item You will be asked if to open the Rgui of your new R.
#' \item Lastely - you can close the current session of your old R. 
#' } 
#' 
#' @details
#' It is worth noting that the function assumes that you are installing R in the same directory as before. That is, if the old R was on: D:\R\R-3.0.0 then the new R will be on D:\R\R-3.0.1.
#' @param fast logical (default is FALSE). If TRUE, it overrides other parameters and uses a set of defaults to make the
#' R installation as fast as possible: no news, installr R, copy packages and Rprofile, keep
#' old packages, updated packages, without quiting current R or starting the new R.
#' don't use GUI, check MD5sums, keep installed file in the \link{getwd}.
#' @param browse_news if TRUE (and if there is a newer version of R) - it opens the browser to the NEWS of the latest version of R, for the user to read through
#' @param install_R TRUE/FALSE - if to install a new version of R (if one is available).  If missing (this is the default)  - the user be asked if to download R or not.Of course the installation part itself (the running of the .exe file) is dependent on the user.
#' @param copy_packages TRUE/FALSE - if to copy your packages from the old version of R to the new version of R. If missing (this is the default)  - the user will be asked for his preference (he should say yes, unless he is using a global library folder).
#' @param copy_Rprofile.site logical - if to copy your Rprofile.site from the old version of R to the new version of R. If missing (this is the default)  - the user will be asked for his preference (he should say yes, unless he is using a global library folder).
#' @param update_packages TRUE/FALSE - if to update your packages in the new version of R (all packages will be updated without asking confirmation per package) If missing (this is the default)  - the user will be asked for his preference (he should say yes, unless he is using a global library folder).  This is done by calling the Rscript in the new R.
#' @param keep_old_packages - if the keep the packages in the library of the old R installation. If missing (this is the default)  - the user will be asked for his preference (he should say yes, unless he is using a global library folder).
#' @param start_new_R TRUE/FALSE - if to start the new R (Rgui) after we will quit the old R. Default is TRUE. It will try to start the 64 bit R version, if it does not exist, the 32 bit will be started. This may be less useful for people using RStudio or the likes.
#' @param quit_R TRUE/FALSE - if to quite R after the installation and package copying or not. If missing (this is the default) - the user is asked what to do.
#' @param print_R_versions if to tell the user what version he has and what is the latest version (default is TRUE)
#' @param GUI a logical indicating whether a graphics menu should be used if available.  If TRUE, and on Windows, it will use \link{winDialog}, otherwise it will use \link[utils]{menu}.
#' @param to_checkMD5sums Should we check that the new R installation has the files we expect it to (by checking the MD5 sums)? default is TRUE.  It assumes that the R which was isntalled is the latest R version. parameter is passed to install.R()
#' @param keep_install_file If TRUE - the installer file will not be erased after it is downloaded and run.
#' @param download_dir A character of the directory into which to download the file. (default is \link{tempdir}())
#' @param silent If TRUE - enables silent installation mode.
#' @param setInternet2 logical. Should setInternet2(TRUE) be run.
#' @param ... Other arguments (this is currently not used in any way)
#' @return a TRUE/FALSE value on whether or not R was updated.
